## About Me

I’m a Ph.D. student in Computer Science Department at the **University of Virginia**, advised by **Prof. Kevin Skadron**.  
My work spans **computer architecture** and **domain-specific accelerators**, with a focus on **Processing-in-Memory (PIM)** and efficient systems for **graph analytics**, **video/vision models**, and **genomics**.

I enjoy building end-to-end systems—prototyping hardware-aware kernels, writing scalable C/C++/Python code, and validating ideas on real platforms.

## Research Interests

- Processing-in-Memory (PIM) and memory-centric acceleration  
- Domain-specific accelerators for **LLMs**, **vision (e.g., SAM2)**, and **graph analytics**  
- High-performance genomics (metagenomic alignment, fast approximate matching)  
- Compiler/hardware co-design, performance modeling, and benchmarking
